        "\n",
        "Carmack said Friday his new artificial general intelligence startup, called Keen Technologies (perhaps a reference to id’s “Commander Keen“), has raised $20 million in a financing round from former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Cue founder Daniel Gross. Stripe co-founder and CEO Patrick Collison, Shopify co-founder and CEO Tobi Lütke, and storied venture fund Sequoia are among those investing in the round, he said.\n",
        "“This is explicitly a focusing effort for me. I could write a $20M check myself, but knowing that other people’s money is on the line engenders a greater sense of discipline and determination. I had talked about that as a possibility for a while, and I am glad Nat pushed me on it,” he said in a tweet.\n",
        "AGI, short for “artificial general intelligence,” is a category of AI systems that can theoretically perform any task that a human can. That’s as opposed to AI systems today, which are designed for narrow, specific applications like generating art, driving cars, and playing video games. Some optimists believe AGI could be achieved within the next century, thanks to emerging algorithmic techniques and increasingly powerful computer hardware. Others, including the chief scientist at Carmack’s current employer, Yann LeCun, have cast doubt on the notion that AGI will ever be a reality.\n",
        "For his part, Carmack seems firmly in the optimist camp. Speaking to MIT research scientist Lex Fridman on a recent podcast, he said that he believes AI will someday reach the point where it behaves akin to a human being or living creature, capable of becoming a “universal remote worker.”\n",
        "“I do not believe in fast takeoffs … [but] I think that we will go from a point where we start seeing [AI-powered] things that credibly look like animals,” Carmack said. “I think animal intelligence is closer to human intelligence than a lot of people like to think and … There’s just that smooth spectrum of how the brain developed and cortexes and scaling of different things going on there.”\n",
        "Carmack goes on to note that his interest in AGI was in part spurred by Sam Altman, who he says tried to recruit him to join OpenAI. (Altman is one of the original co-founders of OpenAI, the high-profile AI research lab based in San Francisco.) Altman, who’s previously said he expects AI to one day surpass human intelligence, has been vocal about his concerns about AGI — specifically how it might damage society if built or used incorrectly.\n",
        "Carmack will still continue to consult with Meta on VR matters, but his work with the social juggernaut, he said, will consume only 20% of his time. Carmack moved to a “consulting CTO” position at Oculus in November 2019 to devote more time to researching AI.\n",
        "Carmack isn’t the only storied technologist to found an ambitious AI startup recently. For roughly a year, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and founding DeepMind member Mustafa Suleyman have been building Inflection AI, a startup that seeks to translate human interactions into a language computers can understand. Former VP of research at OpenAI Dario Amodei is among the co-founders of Anthropic, which for most of 2021 and into this year has studied the behaviors of AI text-generating systems like OpenAI’s GPT-3.'''"

The startup, which just raised a $13 million Series A, relies on a combination of its proprietary battery pack and charging infrastructure to achieve such a feat.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exponent Energy’s business model is geared toward OEMs building commercial EVs for fleet purposes. Ideally, the company works with the OEM to integrate its battery pack, or e^pack, that can then be charged quickly via Exponent’s network of chargers, or e^pumps. Earlier this month, Exponent announced its first partnership with Altigreen, an Indian electric cargo vehicle manufacturer, launching the Exponent-enabled Altigreen neEV HD, a three-wheeler that both companies say can be fully charged, from 0% to 100%, in 15 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The rub is that the battery pack only charges that quickly when it’s being charged on Exponent’s charging infrastructure — if the e^pack is being charged at a standard charging station, it’ll take about 60 minutes, according to the company. Likewise, the e^pumps don’t deliver the same rapid charge to all EVs, so the two must be scaled side-by-side. This is how Exponent hopes to monetize its energy offerings. It will earn revenue from both the sale of the battery pack to OEMs and the charging on a recurring basis, according to Arun Vinayak, Exponent’s co-founder and CEO.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For comparison, Exponent’s business model is a somewhat similar model to Gogoro, the Taiwanese company that works with OEMs to integrate its swappable batteries into their electric two-wheelers while simultaneously building out swapping stations around the country.\n",
        "\n",
        "Aside from the monetization logic of including the battery pack and charging infrastructure as a package deal, Vinayak says it just makes sense to do so from a technology perspective.\n",
        "\n",
        "“15-min rapid charging is a two-sided problem,” said Vinayak. “It’s not just the battery but also the charger. The e^pump delivers 600A of current to the e^pack (15x industry standard) while managing individual cell characteristics, including thermals to ensure safety, long battery life and performance consistency, even at 50 degrees Celsius. Since our technology is present on both sides, we’re able to manage the flow of energy far more efficiently, safely and rapidly.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Building out such a network will require funds, which is where Exponent’s Series A comes in. The round, which was led by Lightspeed with participation from YourNest VC, 3one4 Capital and AdvantEdge VC, will be used to scale up the e^pump network to 100 location points in each city Exponent expands into, starting with Bengaluru and eventually making its way to New Delhi, according to Vinayak. The company also aims to deploy 2,000 Exponent-enabled vehicles as part of its partnership with Altigreen.'''"

The news follows years of collaboration between the two companies in Las Vegas.\n",
        "\n",
        "The launch of the IONIQs, which marks the turnover of Motional’s fleet of BMW-based AVs, is right on schedule. Motional and Lyft said last November that they would aim to start transporting passengers using the Hyundai vehicles in the City of Sin by the second half of 2022, with a full-scale commercial launch set for 2023.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similar to Motional’s autonomous ride-hailing service that the company launched with Via in February, riders will not be charged for autonomous Lyft rides — the companies are mutually focused on rider feedback, said a company spokesperson. The spokesperson also noted that Motional has a permit to conduct fully driverless testing anywhere in Nevada, and that Motional and Lyft will secure the appropriate permits to start conducting commercial rides in fully driverless vehicles ahead of the launch in 2023.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles has not responded to TechCrunch’s requests for clarification on what permits those might be, but a spokesperson from the department previously told TechCrunch the state is working on drafting new legislation around AVs. Nevada’s current legislation doesn’t make a distinction between testing or operating AVs with a human safety operator onboard or without, nor does it include specific language around commercializing robotaxi or autonomous delivery.\n",
        "\n",
        "Motional did not share how many IONIQ 5s will be deployed in Las Vegas, but the company did say it will continue to expand its fleet over the course of 2022 as it gears up for its commercial launch next year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Any Lyft rider in Las Vegas can request a Motional AV, according to the spokesperson. There will be two vehicle operators present in the front seats — presumably one behind the steering wheel in case a human needs to take over, and one in the passenger seat to record data and observations. The service route is focused on high-traffic and popular destinations along the Vegas strip and will only be available during daytime hours, which is fair when one considers that not many AV systems are trained to spot and avoid drunk hooligans vomiting on the street.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customers who order a robotaxi ride can use the Lyft app to unlock the doors of the autonomous IONIQs. While inside the vehicle, riders can interact with an in-ride display that allows them to start the ride or contact customer support. Many of the features within the vehicles come from years of testing and rider feedback from over 100,000 rides over the last four years, according to Motional.\n",
        "\n",
        "Motional has said for a time that it plans to expand to other major U.S. cities after commercially launching in Las Vegas, but the company hasn’t said which other cities it is targeting. Like 47 other companies, Motional has a permit to test its driverless technology in California, a state that has become a key battleground for companies like Cruise and Waymo. Indeed, in May, Motional began a delivery pilot with Uber Eats in Santa Monica, and in July the company expanded its autonomous testing in San Diego. However, Motional might look further afield for less competition. Late last year, Motional began increasing public road testing in its hometown of Boston, and in order to really stand out amongst the competition, putting an AV service on the icy streets of New England might be just the right challenge.\n",

The company reported its second-quarter earnings Monday after the bell. The startup was the first scooter operator to go public via the SPAC route, and many in the industry wish it wasn’t so after consistently meh earnings reports.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since Helbiz’s public debut in August 2021, its earnings reports have shown a company that burns through dwindling cash reserves, doesn’t pull in enough revenue to make up for its high costs of operations and keeps pivoting away from core operations into new, and sometimes strange, business units.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Helbiz’s revenue has increased slightly quarter over quarter and year over year, Monday’s report tells a similar story.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we dig into the financials, a little context. In late June, Helbiz signed a letter of intent to buy Wheels, another shared micromobility operator, by the end of the year. In the midst of this, there were multiple times when Helbiz employees in U.S. and Serbian offices had to wait for delayed payments. Sources told TechCrunch that aside from late paychecks, Helbiz is suffering from chronically late scooter shipments and a general lack of company structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite lackluster earnings, Helbiz’s stock is trading higher than its public market rival Bird, which also announced earnings today. Today, at $1.43 after hours, Helbiz is up 12.6%. That is largely attributable to Helbiz CEO Salvatore Palella’s acquisition of 252,636 shares of the company at an average price of $3 — a transaction that is valued at $757,908. Also, that number is still a far cry from the $10.92 at which Helbiz opened.\n",
        "\n",
        "Helbiz’s Q2 2022 Financials\n",
        "Helbiz closed out the second quarter with $4.4 million in revenue, which is up 46% from the same period last year and 33% from last quarter. Mobility, or shared micromobility rides, made up more than half of the second quarter’s total revenue at $2.7 million, up from $1.6 million in Q1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Helbiz reported around 1.2 million rides in Q2, which is nearly double its Q1 rides, but only a slight increase YoY. Unlike Bird, Helbiz doesn’t appear to report the number of vehicles it has on the ground, nor its rides per vehicle per day.\n",
        "\n",
        "The remaining $1.7 million in revenue came from “the incremental contribution from Media and Kitchen,” said Helbiz chief financial officer Giulio Profumo in a statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "During Q3 2021, Helbiz launched Helbiz Live, a sports streaming platform that is currently showing Italy’s Series B soccer, NCAA football and basketball, and MLB games. Helbiz expects to generate $6 million during the first Series B season, some of which must have already been realized in Q2 2022.\n",
        "\n",
        "Around the same time that Helbiz launched Live, it also introduced Helbiz Kitchen, a ghost kitchen delivery service. The company was coy about how much revenue the new service has brought in, but Kitchen apparently delivered something. Helbiz said in the first half of the year, revenue nearly doubled sequentially. Of course, doubled from zero isn’t exactly a massive achievement.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Importantly, growth was solid in our core mobility business and we are improving margins as we bring down mobility cost of revenue,” said Profumo. “Even with our cost-control focus, we are investing effectively and efficiently in talent, advertising, marketing, and R&D to sustain our pace of expansion.”\n",
        "\n",
        "Helbiz’s operating expenses did decrease slightly QoQ, but at $20.8 million, they nearly doubled YoY. Loss from operations was down at $16.4 million from $18 million in Q1, but Helbiz’s net loss of $19.7 million is about flat QoQ.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The company finished the quarter with $2.5 million in cash, which is up from $1 million last quarter, but way down from $21 million during the same period last year. Helbiz had to raise $10 million this quarter via a new issue of convertible notes. In July and August, Helbiz also raised another $5 million to fund its “multiple growth opportunities,” according to Profumo.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first half of the year saw Helbiz use about $4.7 million in cash to fund its micromobility operations. The company paid $3.5 million to vehicle manufacturers as deposits for e-bikes, e-scooters and e-mopeds, vehicles that Helbiz expects to be delivered throughout the year. And while Helbiz’s acquisition of Wheels will be mainly stock, Helbiz put down a $1 million deposit to enter into the letter of intent, and invested $100,000 in operating licenses, which it has categorized as intangible assets.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Looking forward, we will deploy more vehicles, pursue more micro-mobility licenses, and drive expansion in Asia Pacific,” said the CFO. Helbiz recently launched shared e-scooter operations in Australia and expanded its existing fleets in the U.S. and Italy.\n",

        "Or, as Rose Rocket co-founder and CEO Justin Sky explained to TechCrunch in an interview, TMS is a somewhat generic moniker that one might compare to ERP (enterprise resource planning). Sky added that he often describes what Rose Rocket is building as a NetSuite for trucking companies.\n",

        "\n",
        "For example, Rose Rocket offers the same software to both freight brokers and trucking companies. If a freight broker sends work to a trucking company and both use the startup’s software, Sky said that the work can proceed as if each company was reading off the same sheet music. Instead, of say, one of the parties playing a Chopin nocturne while the other plunked out a free jazz solo.\n",

Trucking as an industry, you won’t be utterly shocked to learn, is not precisely fully digitized yet. That could provide a large total addressable market (TAM) for Rose Rocket to sell into given how large trucking is as both a business (and employer).\n",

        "\n",
        "That Rose Rocket is a Canadian company — albeit one with U.S. incorporation, essentially a requirement to raise money in North America — is notable. The Canadian startup market has come a long way since Shopify broke into the larger business consciousness. We should probably pay it more heed.\n",

        ".bit-powered identities come in the form of its namesake domain name. This is how it works: pick a .bit alias, link it up with the addresses of your crypto or NFT wallets that .bit currently supports, and all the data and assets from those wallets will now sit under .bit’s “data container” and be displayed on your .bit page.\n",

        "The bookkeeping and customer relationship management Pastel launched last year recorded more than 100,000 merchant sign-ups by December 2021, said Okonkwo. The free app currently has more than 45,000 active merchant users. Pastel has recently added more features for merchants to capture more value in this chain. However, unlike other platforms that have bundled several features into one app, Pastel chose a different strategy and made each product standalone: Quick Receipt and Pastel Financing.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "“Our thought process was to get traction quickly by solving a merchant’s pain point with a free and easy solution. The next step was to capture value. So we added value capture features to the Sabi app that our customers love. Now we are building a lot more,” Okonkwo said about the company’s decision to build three standalone platforms instead of coupling them all into one app. “The way we’ve thought about it is, as opposed to creating a super app that a lot of other fintechs have or are in pursuit of, we are taking a more platform approach, meaning that any Pastel user can create an account with any of our apps. With the same login they can access all the other solutions that we’re providing.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The Quick Receipt app provides businesses with simple invoicing and receipts tools and over 60,000 active merchant users. On the other hand, the Swift Money app, which leverages local saving groups called ajo in Nigeria to provide financing for businesses, has been stealthily built for the last three months through Pastel Financing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ajo or esusu is a popular financial scheme in Nigeria where a group of people contributes money in varying intervals to a leader who stores the cash on their behalf. They can have different purposes for engaging in this activity, such as saving toward a particular goal or accessing a large pool of credit.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Swift Money app is designed to work with already established ajo leaders and their groups. Pastel does not aim to replace these leaders, but rather provide them with tools to better track their groups’ well-being, as well as provide financing for the group members. In addition to engaging with the formalities of cash collection and depositing cash in a [Pastel] bank account for savings, the leader downloads the app to set up profiles for members. When any of the members (which in this case are merchants) want to access loans, the leader requests on the app, the member is evaluated based on their saving history and if credit worthy, a business loan is disbursed to them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The leader is then in charge of recollection of these loans to a pastel account similar to the way they have always done their savings collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pastel only started making revenue recently and does so by charging interest and a small fee on these loans; it also has access to savings to use as a float for loan financing. The one-year-old company plans to raise debt capital by January to complement this process, Okonkwo said. “We’ve not raised debt now because we’ve not scaled out our loan product.”\n",
        "\n",
        "The U.S.-headquartered and Lagos-based Pastel isn’t the only startup operating in this line of business. In the last 24 months, several startups across West Africa, including Kippa, Bumpa (which recently launched a social commerce integration with Meta), OZÉ and Bamba, have ventured to serve small and medium businesses with bookkeeping tools and credit. While they offer almost identical features such as handling bookkeeping, managing inventory and tracking sales, Okonkwo argues that Pastel’s product-centric approach distinguishes the company from others.\n",
        "\n",
        "“As a team, we are taking a product-led growth approach where we iterate after doing massive amounts of research into how users are using the solutions and what they are asking for,” said the co-founder. The new capital will assist Pastel in increasing its efforts in this area as it looks to expand its product offerings and develop more productivity and finance management features and tools around group savings, loans and payments for small businesses.'''"
